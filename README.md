## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- npm or Yarn
- Expo CLI
- Firebase account
- Android/iOS emulator or physical device

   git clone https://github.com/mixihuyen/YogaCustomerApp.git
   cd YogaCustomerApp
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

   ```

3. **Configure Firebase**:
   - Create a Firebase project at [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
   - Add an Android app and download `google-services.json`.
   - Place `google-services.json` in the `android/` directory.
   - Update Firebase configuration in the app (e.g., `src/config/firebase.js`).

4. **Run the app**:
   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```
   - Scan the QR code with **Expo Go** on your device.
   - Or run on an emulator:
     ```bash
     npx expo start --android
     ```

5. **Build APK**:
   - Install EAS CLI:
     ```bash
     npm install -g eas-cli
     ```
   - Log in to Expo:
     ```bash
     eas login
     ```
   - Build the APK:
     ```bash
     npx eas-cli build --platform android --profile development
     ```

## üõë Challenges and Solutions
- **Dependency Conflicts**: Resolved `ERESOLVE` errors by updating `package.json` and using `--legacy-peer-deps`.
- **Permission Issues**: Fixed `EACCES` errors with `sudo` or changing `node_modules` ownership.
- **Build Configuration**: Added `expo-dev-client` and configured `eas.json` for development builds.
